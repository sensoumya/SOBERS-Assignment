# SOBERS Assignment

### Introduction
For this assignment our client has a web application that deals with accounting.
One of the features is to import csv's with bank statements.

In this assignment, 
There is already a version that runs for a single bank.
In this assignment a version is needed that is not a POC(Proof of Concept) but will be used as the main point for the bank integration feature. There for maintenance and extensibility will be important. 
Your task will be to create a script that parses data from different banks.
In the future the client would like to intergrate with integrate banks.

### Assignment
You are tasked to create a script that will parse multiple csv's and create a unified csv.
There are 3 different csv's, this will increase in the future.
The client has a hard requirement that the result is stored as a csv file.
But json and xml will be used in the future, maybe even storing the result in a database.

In the data folder there are 3 csv's with banking data.
Since the csv's come from different banks the layout of data can differ.
The bank statements have data from the month October.

### Scoring
Create a script according to above specified requirements.
You are allowed to take as much time as needed, But try to manage your time to around 1 or 2 hours.
Since we are a Python shop the script must be done with Python.
Scoring is based on:
- Correctness
- Code architecture
- Maintainability
- Testability
- Extendibility
- Pythonicness of code

Tests are not required, but plus points for tests.
This is a moment to show your skills. But remember simple is better then complex.
Try to solve the assignment with the standard library of Python.

Note: The assignment example files are meant to be easy.
The focus should be on the scoring points.
